# Problem: It is a manual process to surface campaign performance metric at the overall (campaign blend) view of performance metrics.

# It takes time for me to surface all test / campaign metrics for the various tests we are running. If you look at tests by platform, we're running a total of four tests at once. The analysis also requires digging at device & campaign break-outs.

# I need a solution that can surface the overall performance metrics at the overall network & test grouping level, then by device, then by campaign.


# Goal: The goal of this project is to develop an automated campaign experiments report that visually describes aggregate performance for active experiments by experiment name, device & campaign levels.

# Objectives: 
# 1. Write an application that creates & manages a campaign experiments table.
# 2. Develop a summary view of active tests, start dates, duration, days left and summary statistics.
# 3. Provide an output of daily data with more rigorous statistical analysis.
